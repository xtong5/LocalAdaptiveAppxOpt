\opening{Dear Prof.\ Novak,}

\begin{center} \textbf{ Revised Version of \\
		\emph{Local Adaption for Approximation and 
Minimization of Univariate Functions}} \end{center}
Enclosed please find the revised version of our manuscript for possible publication in the 
Joseph Traub memorial issue of the Journal of Complexity.  We thank you  and the 
referees for your helpful comments.  Here is a summary of the changes that we have 
made:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We have shortened the manuscript to 28 pages in draft form by shortening the 
	introduction, the numerical examples, and the discussion.
	
	\item We have explained the key ideas behind our algorithms at an earlier point in the 
	manuscript, namely, the introduction.
	
	\item We have defined $\norm[{[\alpha,\beta]}]{f''}$ in terms of the Lipschitz constant 
	for $f'$ in (4), as suggested by a referee.  In (4) we have also introduced the notation 
	$\norm[-\infty,{[\alpha,\beta]}]{f''}$ to denote the minimum of the corresponding 
	difference quotient.  
	
	\item We do not think of $f''$ as an interval valued function anymore.  This has led to a 
	modification of our definition of the cone, $\cc$, of input functions and modifications 
	to Algorithms $A$ and $M$.
	
	\item We have added references to relevant work by Plaskota and work by Horn.
	
	\item We have added a paragraph describing the advantages of adaptive algorithms 
	over nonadaptive algorithms for problems defined on cones of functions, which was 
	prompted by a question of Henryk Wo\'zniakowski at his birthday conference.
	
	\item We have tried to correct all of the typos pointed out by the referees.


\end{itemize}


\closing{Sincerely yours,}
